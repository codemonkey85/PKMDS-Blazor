Whenever you work on code, please ensure that the app version number in /.Directory.Build.props is updated correctly. I use the format yyyy.mm.dd.# - for instance, 2026.01.03.0 is for January 3, 2026. The last number is the zero-based build number, so 0 means it's the first build for that day. 1 would be the second build, 2 would be the third, etc.

Please also do your best to respect the existing code format and style. You can reference /.editorconfig as well.

Please note, in order to build Pkmds.Web, you will need to first install the wasm-tools workload like so:

```
dotnet workload install wasm-tools
```

You can check out the WARP.md file at the repository root for further details generated by WARP.

This app depends heavily on PKHeX.Core (https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX). I'm also trying to keep the PKHeX WinForms app in mind for UI / UX, and particularly as an example of how to leverage PKHeX.Core.

If it turns out there are any issues with PKHeX.Core, like bugs, please report those on the issue and / or pull request you are working on. Feel free to add code comments about these issues as well.
