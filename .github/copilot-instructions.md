Please do your best to respect the existing code format and style. You can reference /.editorconfig as well.

Please note, in order to build Pkmds.Web, you will need to first install the wasm-tools workload like so:

```
dotnet workload install wasm-tools
```

You can check out the AGENTS.md file at the repository root for further details generated by WARP.

This app depends heavily on PKHeX.Core (https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX). I'm also trying to keep the PKHeX WinForms app in mind for UI / UX, and particularly as an example of how to leverage PKHeX.Core.

If it turns out there are any issues with PKHeX.Core, like bugs, please report those on the issue and / or pull request you are working on. Feel free to add code comments about these issues as well.
